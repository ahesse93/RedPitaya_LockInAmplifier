Lock in amplifier implementation running on the RedPitaya's FPGA

To edit the project source RedPitaya_LockInAmplifier.tcl in Vivado

To just use the lock in use LockIn.bit


Still in a really early stage, so there are timing issues and no GUI

To change settings while running use the Red Pitaya's monitor tool after connecting to it via SSH

The address for the input gain is 0x41220000, the output gain 0x41210000, the phase 0x41200000,
the frequency 0x41230000, and for the low pass filter frequency 0x41240000
